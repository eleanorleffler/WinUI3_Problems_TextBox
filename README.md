# WinUI3_Problems_TextBox

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating a TextBox within a ContentDialog in both UWP and WinUI3 Desktop.

The UWP sample code works as expected - the TextBox within the ContentDialog allows the user to type text into it. 

The WinUI3 Desktop sample builds but the TextBox within the ContentDialog does not contain the text typed.
